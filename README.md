# weather-dashboard
A weather dashboard application

## Description
A weather application that displays the weather forecast for the current date as well
as a 5-day future forecast. It takes user input for cities and updates the display with the related weather information. The wind speed, humidity and temperature are captured. Also an image that depicts the weather condition is rendered to the display so that the condition can be visualized. The application also stores user search history for easy navigation even on the next visit. Find the link to the deployed application [here](https://brian-machiestay.github.io/weather-dashboard/).
